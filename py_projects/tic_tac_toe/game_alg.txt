data:
	game_over: determines wether or not to end the game
	grid: array of arrays that is the gane board
	turn: determines whos turn it is, for token printing
	result: winner, or draw

methods:
	game: major game loop, has the while loop that controls game
	get_coords: gets the board coords, also determines validity
	place_token: takes coords, places the token into the grid
	print_board: prints the grid to the console

   row = part of input
   col = second half of input

   while coords are not valid
      ask for coords
